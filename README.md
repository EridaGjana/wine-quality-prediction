# wine-quality-prediction
Predictive modeling project using classification algorithms (logistic regression, LDA, kNN) to predict wine quality from physicochemical data. Implemented in R with cross-validation and model comparison.


## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning classification algorithms to predict wine quality using physicochemical data.

## Dataset
Wine Quality dataset containing chemical properties such as acidity, alcohol level, and pH.

## Methods
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Cross-validation for model evaluation

## Tools & Technologies
- R
- Statistical modeling
- Machine learning classification

## Results
Logistic regression achieved the best predictive performance compared to other models.

## Key Insights
Chemical features such as acidity and alcohol level play a significant role in predicting wine quality.
